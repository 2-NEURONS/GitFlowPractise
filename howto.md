# How to do this workshop

Form teams of **five**

One person in the team fork this repo into your GitHub profile: https://github.com/codex-academy/GitFlowPractise

Now add the other **4** team members as a collaborator on your fork of this repo.

Each team member clone the newly forked repo onto their PC into their projects folder.

## Do this

### The repo owner:

Create a `develop` branch from the `master` and push it remotely. 

### Other collaborators

Fetch the remote `develop` branch by doing a `git fetch`
Be sure you can check out the `develop` branch locally using `git checkout develop` - you will create all your feature branches from the `develop` branch.
