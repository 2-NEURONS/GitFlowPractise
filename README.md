# GitFlowPractise

A text-file based thing for practising Git Flow workflow. Follow the [git flow model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) and take one feature per person. Don't worry about Hotfix branches for now: just concentrate on using `master`, `develop`, and `feature` branches, and use `git tag` for a release.

Get started by doing a `git clone` on this repo.
